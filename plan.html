<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Alexandra Cameron<br>

<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>The site aims to inspire a younger audience to become involved with cosplaying and attended the monthly parties. Our mission is to increase the number of our cosplayers by 30% within the first two months of being online through expanding the current age group of customers, and inturn, increase the number of costumes made per week.</p>

<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>In order to evaluate the success of the site and determine if the mission is being reached, party sign ups and costume orders will need to be monitored. Therefore, when people sign up for the monthly parties, ages of attendees will be recorded. This can then be checked with information gathered on the night as people arrive and purchase their ticket. As people arrive their name can be crossed off a list that contains the information they submitted on the website. Then, after the party the list can be checked to see if the younger crowd attended.</p>
<p>Orders also need to be monitored. As orders are placed customers can be asked how they heard about CossiePlay. This information can be recorded and website success can be monitored.</p>
<p>At the end of each month this information can be evaluated to determine if the website is reaching its desired potential or if another strategy needs to be considered.
</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>CossiePlay typically gets cosplayers between the ages of 35 and 50. However, in order to appeal to a younger audience, the target audience for this site is highschool kids and young adults (aged between 15 and 25).</p>
<p>The site will be intentionally designed to cater for this target audience by being clear, concise and consistent. The structure of the site has been chosen as it leads the customer through a desired thought process. The informatuon architechture has been mapped to find a layout that best achieves the sites goals.</p>
<p>The home page consists of only the 'Annoucements', an image (of people within the target audience) and a call to action - the party sign up. This get's people interested and wanting to know more about the company and why everyone is in fancy dress (in the image). Therefore, the 'About Us' is the next page. This allows the customer to become familiar with cosplay and want to get involved with the party. This leads us to the 'Party' page. The party page has the cost, sign up details and party guidelines, along with a picture of a DJ. The picture of the DJ will interest people within the target audience. It also has a link to the photo gallery from the previous CossiePlay party. This gives people the option to either click through and sign up straight away, or look at photos first.</p>
<p>If they decide to view the 'Gallery' page they will see photos that show how fun the parties are, and another link to sign up for the next one (the call to action). This sign up link takes the customer back to the party page with all the details and a link to sign up.</p>
<p>After the customer has signed up for the party, their next thought wil be that they need a costume. Thus, the 'Prices' page is next. This page explains that the customer can have a custom-made costume done or buy a second-hand one. The 'Costume Examples' link is larger than the others, as the main call to action on this page is for customers to order a custom-made costume. The link takes the customer to a page with images of possible costume ideas and and a big 'Contact Us' link at the top and bototm. The photos are in an order that will relate to people within the target audience. However, the images of children have also been included so as not to alienate other possible vistors to the site - eg. the current 35 - 50yo who may have children who want to participate. The 'Contact Us' links takes you to the final page on the CossiePlay website - 'Contact Us'.</p>
<p>It is evident that the main call to actions for this site are for people to sign up for the monthly parties and for people to order custom-made costumes. There are links to external sites but they are not as evident as the internal ones as we are aiming to keep people on our sites long enough for them to sign up or buy a costume - or both!</p>
<p>The site will not have larges amounts of reading as this age bracket generally wants fast scanning and to the point information. This target audience generally prefers more visual content, rather than wordy, boring and lengthy material. They do not want to or feel they have the time to read large amounts of text.</p>
<p>The site will be easy to operate, have interesting, yet not distracting, colour scheme, typography and content. Pictures will be utilised to capture attention and help to further explain the parties and costumes CossiePlay offers, without adding larges amounts of text.</p>
<p>The pictures will help to portray how fun and socially interactive the parties are. They will also show the detail and quality of the CossiePlay costumes and how they help set the mood for the parties. Therefore, encoraging people to buy more costumes and want to participate each month.</p>
